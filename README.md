# 🎓 FinalCapstone – Political Bias Tracker by Adam Kramez

Welcome, and thank you for visiting my final-year Computer Science capstone project!

This ePortfolio showcases the original and enhanced technical artifacts related to **Tilted**, a full-stack political bias tracking web application. The project combines my interests in media literacy with core software engineering principles to deliver a meaningful and socially relevant tool.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- 🗂️ **Backend** code: [`ArtifactsEnhancements/Databases/backend`](./ArtifactsEnhancements/Databases/backend)
- 🎨 **Frontend** code: [`ArtifactsEnhancements/SoftwareDesign/frontend`](./ArtifactsEnhancements/SoftwareDesign/frontend)
- 📦 **MongoDB Dataset (JSON)**: [`ArtifactsEnhancements/Databases/publications.json`](./ArtifactsEnhancements/Databases/political_bias_tracker.publications.json) 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Tilted is built using the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB** – Database of publication bias ratings
- **Express** & **Node.js** – Backend API
- **React** – Frontend UI (rebuilt from an earlier Angular version)
- **Tailwind CSS** – Modern, utility-first styling
- **JWT** – Authentication

## ✅ Key Features

- ✏️ Article bias analysis via domain lookup
- 📊 User dashboards and bias summaries
- 🔒 Secure login with hashed credentials (bcrypt + JWT)
- 📚 Database ingestion & cleaning with Puppeteer
- 📈 Aggregated bias rating visualized with a protractor-style arrow

> ⚠️ **Important:** This application is still under development. Not all news publications have been added to the MongoDB database yet. As a result, some URLs may not return bias information.
